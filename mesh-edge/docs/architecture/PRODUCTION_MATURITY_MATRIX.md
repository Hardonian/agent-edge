# MEL Production Maturity Matrix

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** March 2026  
**Status:** Canonical Assessment

This document provides a ruthlessly honest assessment of MEL's production readiness. Each area is classified based on actual code verification, not documentation aspiration.

## Classification Legend

| Classification | Meaning |
|----------------|---------|
| **DONE_REAL** | Genuinely working; verified in code and tests |
| **PARTIAL_REAL** | Partially implemented; functional but incomplete |
| **SCAFFOLDED_ONLY** | Structure exists, scaffolding in place, not functional |
| **MISSING** | Not implemented; no code exists |
| **UNSAFE_OR_MISLEADING** | Exists but has safety issues or misleading behavior |

## A. CORE RUNTIME

### transport reliability
**Classification:** PARTIAL_REAL

**Why it matters:** Without reliable transport, MEL cannot observe the mesh. Transport failures cause data loss and blind spots.

**What breaks if weak:** Silent message loss, incomplete mesh state, false confidence in observability.

**Current state assessment:**
- MQTT transport ([`internal/transport/mqtt.go`](internal/transport/mqtt.go:1)) is fully implemented with QoS acknowledgements, keepalive, reconnect-aware timeouts
- Serial direct-node ([`internal/transport/direct.go`](internal/transport/direct.go:1)) exists but explicitly NOT hardware-verified in repo context
- TCP direct-node ([`internal/transport/direct.go`](internal/transport/direct.go:1)) exists but explicitly NOT hardware-verified in repo context
- Dead letter capture ([`internal/db/db.go`](internal/db/db.go:54)) persists failed messages
- Observation drops tracked per transport
- **Gap:** No hardware-in-the-loop verification for serial/TCP transports

### mesh intelligence
**Classification:** PARTIAL_REAL

**Why it matters:** Understanding mesh topology and health requires aggregating observations into actionable intelligence.

**What breaks if weak:** Operators cannot distinguish normal mesh behavior from degradation.

**Current state assessment:**
- Transport intelligence tables ([`migrations/0007_transport_intelligence.sql`](migrations/0007_transport_intelligence.sql:1)) store snapshots
- Anomaly detection ([`internal/db/transport_intelligence.go`](internal/db/transport_intelligence.go:1)) identifies transport degradation
- Mesh anomaly history ([`migrations/0009_transport_mesh_anomaly_history.sql`](migrations/0009_transport_mesh_anomaly_history.sql:1)) tracks patterns
- Node attribution ([`internal/db/node_attribution.go`](internal/db/node_attribution.go:1)) associates nodes with transports
- **Gap:** No cross-transport deduplication verification for hybrid deployments
- **Gap:** Intelligence is transport-centric, not mesh-centric

### alerting
**Classification:** SCAFFOLDED_ONLY

**Why it matters:** Operators need notification when mesh health degrades.

**What breaks if weak:** Degradation goes unnoticed until catastrophic failure.

**Current state assessment:**
- Transport alerts table exists ([`migrations/0008_transport_intelligence_operability.sql`](migrations/0008_transport_intelligence_operability.sql:1))
- Alert schema supports active/resolved lifecycle
- API endpoints expose alerts ([`internal/web/web.go`](internal/web/web.go:81))
- **Gap:** No notification mechanism (email, webhook, pager)
- **Gap:** No alert acknowledgment workflow
- **Gap:** Alert escalation is unimplemented

### explainability
**Classification:** PARTIAL_REAL

**Why it matters:** Operators must understand why MEL makes recommendations or takes actions.

**What breaks if weak:** Operators cannot trust or debug automated decisions.

**Current state assessment:**
- Policy explanations ([`internal/policy/policy.go`](internal/policy/policy.go:14)) generate recommendations with evidence
- Control decisions ([`internal/control/control.go`](internal/control/control.go:118)) include denial reasons and safety checks
- Diagnostics ([`internal/diagnostics/checks.go`](internal/diagnostics/checks.go:18)) provide actionable findings
- **Gap:** Limited cross-referencing between decisions and their triggering evidence
- **Gap:** No natural language explanation generation

### guarded control
**Classification:** PARTIAL_REAL

**Why it matters:** Automated actions must have safety boundaries to prevent runaway behavior.

**What breaks if weak:** MEL could destabilize the mesh it's meant to observe.

**Current state assessment:**
- Control modes ([`internal/control/control.go`](internal/control/control.go:32)): `disabled`, `advisory`, `guarded_auto`
- Safety checks ([`internal/control/control.go`](internal/control/control.go:77)) enforce reversibility, blast radius, cooldowns
- Action reality table ([`migrations/0011_control_closure.sql`](migrations/0011_control_closure.sql:13)) tracks executable vs advisory-only actions
- **Gap:** Only 5 of 8 actions have working actuators ([`docs/ops/control-plane.md`](docs/ops/control-plane.md:137))
- **Gap:** No operator override during action execution
- **Gap:** Rollback is manually triggered, not automatic

### persistence
**Classification:** DONE_REAL

**Why it matters:** Observability requires historical data for trend analysis and incident investigation.

**What breaks if weak:** Data loss prevents post-incident analysis and trend detection.

**Current state assessment:**
- SQLite storage ([`internal/db/db.go`](internal/db/db.go:63)) with migrations
- Messages, nodes, telemetry, positions, audit logs all persisted
- Dead letters captured ([`internal/db/db.go`](internal/db/db.go:54))
- Transport runtime state persisted
- Control actions and decisions logged
- **Limitation:** No encrypted storage at rest ([`docs/community/claims-vs-reality.md`](docs/community/claims-vs-reality.md:14))

### retention/pruning
**Classification:** PARTIAL_REAL

**Why it matters:** Unbounded growth exhausts disk space and degrades query performance.

**What breaks if weak:** Database corruption, system downtime, data loss.

**Current state assessment:**
- Retention config ([`internal/config/config.go`](internal/config/config.go:58)) supports day-based limits
- Pruning functions ([`internal/db/retention.go`](internal/db/retention.go:8)) for transport intelligence and control history

- **Gap:** No automatic background pruning job
- **Gap:** No size-based retention limits
- **Gap:** No tiered storage (hot/warm/cold)

### health/readiness
**Classification:** PARTIAL_REAL

**Why it matters:** Load balancers and orchestrators need accurate health signals.

**What breaks if weak:** Traffic routed to unhealthy instances; false-positive failures.

**Current state assessment:**
- `/healthz` returns HTTP 200 with `{"ok":true}` for **process liveness only** ([`internal/web/web.go`](internal/web/web.go)).
- `/readyz` and `/api/v1/readyz` share one handler: HTTP **200** when a status snapshot is built and either no transports are enabled (explicit idle) or at least one enabled transport is **ingesting**; HTTP **503** when the snapshot fails or enabled transports are not ingesting ([`internal/web/web.go`](internal/web/web.go)).
- `GET /api/v1/status` remains the detailed transport/system view.
- **Note:** Readiness depends on assembling the same SQLite-backed snapshot as status; a 503 with `error_class=snapshot_unavailable` indicates evidence could not be assembled (often DB/migrations).

### diagnostics
**Classification:** DONE_REAL

**Why it matters:** Operators need tools to diagnose issues without code expertise.

**What breaks if weak:** Longer incident resolution, operator frustration.

- **Gap:** No automated upload mechanism

### frontend/operator console
**Classification:** DONE_REAL

**Why it matters:** Web UI is the primary operator interface for non-CLI users.

**What breaks if weak:** Operator workflow friction; reduced adoption.

**Current state assessment:**
