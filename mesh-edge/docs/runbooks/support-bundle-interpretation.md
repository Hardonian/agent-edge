# Support bundle interpretation guide

This document is for second-line support engineers, incident responders, and anyone who receives a MEL support bundle zip and needs to understand what is inside and how to use it.

## Quick start

1. Unzip the support bundle.
2. Read `MANIFEST.md` — it is the index and provides context for all other files.
3. Start with `investigation.json` for the canonical investigation summary.
4. Use `investigation_cases.json` to inspect bounded case drilldown.
5. Use `timeline.json` for chronological investigation.
6. Use the specific section files (`control_actions.json`, `incidents.json`, `imported_evidence.json`) for targeted drilldown.

## File reference

|File|Contents|When to use|

|`bundle.json`|Full monolith (all sections, machine-readable)|Tooling ingestion; grep for fields|
|`doctor.json`|`mel doctor` output (secrets redacted)|Host and config health|
|`timeline.json`|Full unified event timeline|Chronological investigation|
|`control_actions.json`|Control actions and decisions|Audit trail: who did what and why|
|`incidents.json`|Incident records|Correlation, handoff context|
|`imported_evidence.json`|Remote evidence batches, imported rows, and inspections|Provenance, validation, timing, merge posture|

|`diagnostics.json`|Active diagnostic findings|Issues and recommended next steps|
|`investigation.json`|Canonical investigation summary|Operator attention posture, cases, findings, evidence gaps, recommendations, and physics boundaries|
|`investigation_cases.json`|Expanded investigation cases|Case list plus expanded case detail, linked raw events, timing posture, and case evolution for second-line reconstruction|

## Reading investigation output

Use these meanings consistently:

- `case` = a bounded operator attention object. It is not proof of root cause.
- `finding` = what MEL is observing from available evidence.
- `evidence_gap` = what MEL still does not know and why that matters.
- `recommendation` = the next safe inspection step MEL can justify.

Every case should reduce back to inspectable raw records such as transport runtime, alerts, incidents, timeline events, or imported evidence rows.

Case detail now includes three distinct layers:

- `case` — the current bounded operator posture.
- `linked_events` — exact raw canonical timeline rows that contributed context to the case.
- `evolution` — typed case-evolution entries explaining how the current posture was shaped. These entries may be exact-event-backed, exact-record-backed, or inferred from ordered retained evidence. They are not a hidden incident story log.

When reading `linked_events` versus `evolution`, keep this boundary explicit:

- a linked raw event is a retained fact,
- an evolution entry is MEL's bounded reconstruction of how current case posture was shaped,
- neither one automatically proves causality or root cause.

## Reading the timeline

The timeline is a UNION of disparate event types into a single chronological stream. Each event has explicit posture fields:

### `scope_posture`

|Value|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`local`|Event was recorded by this instance|
|`remote_imported`|Event was imported from another truth domain (offline bundle)|
|`best_effort_fleet`|Correlated across instances; ordering is not strict|

### `timing_posture`

|Value|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`local_ordered`|Strict deterministic order within this instance|
|`receive_time_differs_from_observed_time`|Observed and received timestamps differ; clock skew possible|

## Reading case timing posture

Case detail uses a normalized timing posture so second-line support can tell whether a case sequence is exact or best-effort without reading every raw event first.

|Value|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`locally_ordered`|Linked raw events are local to this MEL instance; sequence is exact only within this database|
|`historical_import_not_live`|Imported evidence is shaping the case as historical context, not live local proof|
|`source_order_known_global_order_unknown`|The case spans more than one evidence domain; some source-local order may be known, but no global total order is implied|
|`ordering_uncertain_clock_skew`|Reported timestamps may reflect skew or observed-vs-received drift|
|`ordering_uncertain_missing_timestamps`|Some records lack the timestamps needed for a clean sequence|
|`merged_best_effort_order`|Merge/dedupe classification affected the case chronology or grouping|
|`mixed_freshness_window`|The case spans stale and fresher evidence windows; freshness and sequence should not be collapsed|

When reviewing a case timeline:

- start with `case.timing.primary_posture`,
- inspect `linked_events` for the exact raw facts,
- then read `evolution` to see how imports, merges, freshness gaps, and recommendations shaped the current case.

### `merge_disposition`

|Value|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`raw_only`|No merge processing; single-origin event|
|`summary_with_contributor_lineage`|Summary with preserved contributor trail|
|`merged_canonical_summary`|Merged from multiple sources into canonical summary|

## Reading imported evidence

`imported_evidence.json` contains batch-level and item-level sections:

- `batches` — persisted import batch audit rows
- `batch_inspections` — decoded batch validation/source drilldown
- `imports` — persisted imported item rows
- `inspections` — normalized per-item provenance/timing/merge drilldown

Each imported item includes:

- **`validation`** — Structured validation outcome (accepted, accepted_with_caveats, rejected) with machine-readable reason codes.
- **`bundle`** — Raw import bundle JSON (the exact file that was imported).
- **`evidence`** — Normalized evidence envelope.
- **`origin_instance_id`** — The MEL instance that *claims* to have originated this evidence.
- **`origin_site_id`** — The site that *claims* to own this evidence.
- **`batch_id` / `source_*`** — The local import batch and local file/source context.
- **`timing_posture`** — How MEL believes the row should be ordered/interpreted.
- **`merge_disposition` / `merge_correlation_id`** — Why MEL kept the row raw, related, or comparable.

**Critical**: "claimed" means the origin fields are self-reported. MEL does not cryptographically verify origin unless external verification is added by the operator.

### Validation outcomes

|Outcome|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`accepted`|Structurally valid, no caveats|
|`accepted_with_caveats`|Structurally valid but with warnings (e.g., partial observation)|
|`rejected`|Structurally invalid or scope conflict|

### Batch outcomes

Batch validation is separate from per-item validation.

|Outcome|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`accepted_with_caveats`|Every item was imported, but the whole batch remains historical/offline/unverified|
|`accepted_partial_bundle`|Some items were imported, some were rejected|
|`rejected`|No item was accepted; the raw batch survives only as audit evidence|

### Reading `remote_evidence_export.json`

This file is a canonical `mel_remote_evidence_batch` payload generated from the imported rows already stored locally.

Use it when you need to:

- hand the exact imported evidence to another MEL instance,
- attach a truthful offline batch to an escalation,
- preserve the distinction between local evidence and imported evidence.

Do not read it as proof of live sync, cross-instance authority, or fleet-wide completeness.

## Reading control actions

Each action includes lifecycle state and evidence chain:

|Field|What to check|
|---|---|
|`lifecycle_state`|pending_approval, approved, executed, rejected, expired|
|`execution_mode`|manual, automated, automation_gated|
|`proposed_by`|Who or what proposed the action|
|`approved_by`|Who approved (empty if auto-executed)|
|`trigger_evidence`|JSON evidence that triggered this action|
|`reason`|Human-readable justification|
|`outcome_detail`|Result of execution|

## What the bundle does NOT tell you

1. **Global fleet health.** The bundle reflects one instance's database. Other instances may have evidence this one does not.
2. **RF coverage.** Packet observations do not prove coverage area or mesh connectivity.
3. **Transport liveness at export time.** The bundle captures database state, not real-time status.
4. **Causal ordering across instances.** Timeline order is instance-local.
5. **Data completeness.** Missing data may indicate transport failure, not health.

## Escalation checklist

Before escalating beyond second-line:

- [ ] Read `MANIFEST.md`
- [ ] Check `diagnostics.json` for active findings
- [ ] Check `timeline.json` for the event sequence leading to the issue
- [ ] Verify transport connectivity in `bundle.json` → `status_snapshot.transports`
- [ ] Check for active freezes in `bundle.json` → `control_plane_state`
- [ ] Note the `fleet_truth` posture — is this a partial-fleet view?
- [ ] Attach operator notes to the relevant incident/action for audit trail
