# MEL CLI: Control Plane Operations

The `mel` CLI provides operators with a direct, high-fidelity interface to the MEL Control Plane.

---

## Approvals (`mel action approve` / `mel action reject`)

Use **`mel action approve`** and **`mel action reject`** as the canonical paths: they run
the service-layer workflow (audit + timeline) and match HTTP semantics.

- MEL is **single-approver** today (`required_approvals: 1`); there is no quorum.
- After approve, stderr summarizes whether **one** queue slot was dequeued in this CLI
  process; that is **not** a backlog worker. Run **`mel serve`** for continuous execution.
- **`mel control approve|reject`** are **break-glass** legacy entrypoints and require
  `--i-understand-break-glass-sod`.

---

## Direct Action (`mel control exec`)

Operators can manually execute any action that MEL's Reality Matrix supports. These actions bypass the "Guarded Automation" confidence check but still record a full audit trail.

```bash
# Force-restart a specific transport
mel control exec --action restart_transport --target mqtt-primary

# Manually trigger a health recheck
mel control exec --action trigger_health_recheck
```

---

## Status and History (`mel control status`)

Display the current control mode, active policies, and recent decision history.

```bash
mel control status --verbose
```

**Key Information:**

- `Mode`: One of `disabled`, `advisory`, `guarded_auto`.
- `Recent Denials`: See exactly why the automated layer blocked an action.
- `Active Actions`: View any actions that have not yet expired or reached a terminal state.

---

## Override & Freeze (`mel control freeze`)

Sometimes a physical transport is unstable enough that even automated restarts might cause more harm. Operators can "freeze" specific targets to prevent any automated actions from being proposed.

```bash
# Prevent any automated control of the 'serial-local' transport
mel control freeze --target serial-local --reason "manual debugging in progress"

# Thaw the transport back to normal operations
mel control thaw --target serial-local
```

---

## Audit Logs (`mel events --category control`)

All control decisions—whether allowed, denied, or manual—are stored in the central audit ledger.

```bash
# View the last 10 control decisions
mel events --category control --limit 10
```

---

## TUI Experience

The `mel panel` command launches an interactive terminal dashboard.
